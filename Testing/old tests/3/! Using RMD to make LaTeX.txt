The intended use when knitting an RMD file to make TeX is that you use that file
with \input. Don't use your RMD-knitr TeX file as your actual file, as it'll
be overwritten every time and your packages won't be loaded (read bottom).

It does work (somewhat) but I do think that minted looks better, as you can also
include minted as a figure, which RMD-knitr won't do.

It'll be extra work, but in the end it WILL look quite a bit nicer to use minted,
as you'd have to do some crazy formatting on your knitr files to get them into shape.

You may be able to do more research on this, as it seems Pandoc accounted for this,
and you may be able to alter its configs for this exact purpose.

looks like a great resource.
