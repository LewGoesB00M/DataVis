Bookdown.org can answer most RMD questions.

In your RMDs, ensure you set {r, fig.align = "center"} for all of your code chunks.

If you condense it all further, i.e. one graph for one chunk, you can actually
put correct syntax captions on the figures generated via fig.cap = "caption"

RMD comments outside of chunks are HTML syntax <!-- comment -->
R comments within chunks are #. These WILL BE visible though.

Your graphs are shown within your LaTeX if you properly use RMD, including
the axes and legends. Therefore, it'll look more professional if you name these
as you did in Intro to Data Sci.

Figure positioning seems to be weird when they're either captioned or aligned.
Evidently, when it's compiled the figure doesn't have any flags set like how
you use [H] for positioning normally.

You could also include images outside of R chunks using actual Markdown syntax,
which would be ![Caption](relativeDir/file.png){width=50%}, but realistically
you'd just do it in your central LaTeX.

You're likely to want your code block preface for almost all of them to be
{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.pos = "H", out.width = "75%"}, optionally using
fig.cap, but only if you're doing a single figure, as fig.cap is applied to all
figures in the block.

Your .gitignore is ignoring Assignment's auxil files. Could cause issues later.

He wants the LaTeX code despite it not being under the markscheme.
Literally just looking to reduce people's marks for no reason.
This module is literally curtains for you.
