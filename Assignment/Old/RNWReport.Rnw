    As of March 31, 2024, Netflix is the most popular television streaming service
    in the world~\autocite{NetflixSubStats}, with over 269,000,000 active paid memberships. 
    This report aims to analyse the library of content found on Netflix and identify 
    key factors associated with the viewership of this content in the interests of furthering
    profit in the sector.

    Data visualisation is a field of data science wherein large datasets are parsed
    using code (most commonly written in Python or R) to produce clear visualisations
    interpretable to a wide audience, even if they do not have in-depth knowledge
    of the dataset. \\

    \noindent This report specifically aims to produce visualisations based on an
    analysis of a large dataset based on the content library available on the Netflix online streaming service. 
    The ever-evolving landscape of streaming services versus traditional television has positioned Netflix
    as a giant in the industry. Central to its success is a vast content library, 
    encompassing a diverse range of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. This report delves 
    into a comprehensive dataset of Netflix's content library, aiming to uncover valuable insights 
    and trends. Through exploratory data analysis, the composition of the library will 
    be examined, including factors such as content popularity by genre and release dates.
    This exploration will not only shed light on Netflix's content strategy but also provide 
    potential indicators of current and future trends within the streaming service and the
    broader entertainment market.\\

    

    \noindent This report is split across three sections:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{motivation and objectives} of this report.
        \item The \textbf{results from experiments} on the dataset.
        \item A \textbf{summary} of overall findings.

    The dominance of Netflix in the entertainment industry is undeniable; as the most popular online streaming
    service with over 269 million active paid memberships \autocite{NetflixSubStats}, it is essential to identify
    what they are doing correctly in the interests of furthering the industry and understanding the preferred
    content of their millions of subscribers.\\

    
    \noindent The dataset in use is \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows/data}{sourced from Kaggle}, a 
    public dataset-sharing website. It contains 8807 rows with twelve columns of data:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item show\_id - A unique ID for each row of the dataset.
        \item type - "Movie" or "TV Show"
        \item title - The title of the content
        \item director - The director of the content
        \item cast - Actors featured in the content
        \item country - Country of production
        \item date\_added - The date when Netflix added the content to the service
        \item release\_year - The date when the content originally released
        \item rating - The age rating of the content
        \item duration - Duration in minutes (for movies) or seasons (for TV shows)
        \item listed\_in - The genre of the content
        \item description - A large text description of the content.
    \end{itemize}

    % Within this report, data pertaining to the content library of TV shows and movies on Netflix will be analysed
    % to identify key factors in the success of said content. 
    % Netflix is a massive service used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and it is therefore
    % important to identify their successes, and how they optimize their content to maximise viewership, revenue 
    % and profit.

    \section{Key questions conerning the data}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How has the content library grown over time?
        \item Which month of the year has the most releases?
        \item Which \textbf{content type} (movies / TV shows) is more frequent?
        \item Which genres are the most frequent?
        \item What is the age rating distribution of the content library?
    \end{itemize}

\section{Data wrangling}
    To be able to analyse the data, it is essential that the data is first in a state that
    can be analysed effectively. To do so, the data must be explored to identify any potential
    issues, and any that are found must be cleaned.
    
    \subsection{Data exploration}
    A good step to take in the initial exploration of the data is to identify if there are any missing values
    in certain columns. To do so, we can convert any instance of a blank string into R's recognised "NA" type and
    then use is.na() to identify how many there are.

    <<>>=
    # Convert blank strings to NA.
    dataDf[dataDf == ""] <- NA

    # Identify rows containing NA.
    naRows <- dataDf[rowSums(is.na(dataDf) > 0),]
    nrow(naRows)
    nrow(naRows)/nrow(dataDf)*100
    @
    
    We can identify that this dataset has 3475 rows where at least one column has missing data, equating to 
    39.46\% of the dataset. To analyse this in further detail to see specifically which columns contain
    missing data, the naniar package can be used to generate a tibble of where the data is missing.

    <<echo = FALSE>>=
    kable(miss_var_summary(dataDf), caption = "Missing variable summary of the dataset", placement = "H", "latex") %>%
    kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position") 
    @

    % unique(dataDf$rating)
    
    A general summary of the data can be obtained using str() to show a small snippet of it.

    <<describeFactorise, tidy = TRUE, size = "footnotesize">>=
    # Factorise relevant categorical columns before the summary for cleaner output.
    factorCols <- c("type", "country", "release_year", "rating", "duration")
    dataDf <- dataDf %>% mutate(across(all_of(factorCols), as.factor))

    # Convert date_added to a date format using Lubridate.
    dataDf$date_added <- mdy(dataDf$date_added)
    
    # Description is very long, so the output of this is limited to 70 characters.
    str(dataDf, vec.len = 1, width = 70, strict.width = "cut")
    
    @

    
    % # The "cast" column contains Unicode characters that cause other miscellaneous errors later,
    % # so the Unicode characters in each row will be removed by running a gsub on the cast column to remove them.
    % # dataDf$cast <- sapply(dataDf$cast, gsub, pattern = "<U\\+200B>", replacement= " ")

    \subsection{Data cleaning}

    \section{Visualisations}
    <<echo=FALSE>>=
    dataDf$year <- year(dataDf$date_added)

    dataDf %>%
    group_by(year, type) %>%
    summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count, color = type)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(~type) +  # Separate lines for movie and TV show
    labs(title = "Growth of Netflix Content Library Over Time",
        x = "Year", y = "Number added", color = "Content Type")
